Controlling WS2812b's over the air with MIDI

This hobbyproject aimed at enabling someone to control WS2812b LEDs using MIDI note on and off commands.

I used Carnique MK2s for receiving MIDI, transferring over the air (RFM69HW) and reacting on the sent packages on the receiving side by flashing LEDs.

More information to follow :)
